v 2.1 (June 2014)
	This is mostly a bug-fixing release. We have fixed a few issues with different compilers
	and platforms and a few severe bugs that could result in segmentation faults.
	- Added support for interaction plugins. Now you can write separate classes to manage custom 
	interactions and load them in oxDNA as plugins. The mechanism is very similar to the one that
	manages observable plugins. See PluginManagement/PluginManager.h for additional documentation.
	- Added a new, improved and safer input parser. User-wise, the only difference with respect to
	the old parser is that it is now possible to put more than a single key-value pair on the same
	line by separating them with semicolons (e.g. key1 = value1; key2 = value2) 
	- Added salt-dependent DNA and RNA interactions. Note that these are still under development
	and then we advise not to use them as they are still subject to changes and possibly unstable.
	- A SRD (stochastic rotational dynamics) thermostat has been added. It works on both CPUs and
	GPUs. It seems working but we did not have thoroughly tested it. Use it at your own risk.
	- Added many observables (in the Observables folder).
	- Plenty of bugfixes, see commit messages for more information.

v 2.0 (March 2014)
