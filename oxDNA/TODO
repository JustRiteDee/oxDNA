===========================================
ARCHITETTURA

1d) Make it so that it is possible to override (all?) the numerical constant of (at least) the DNA interaction

4) Improve testing script (Ryan)

7) Make SimManager more parallel friendly (with Petr)

10) Major/minor grooving

11) Is it possible to have mixed precision on CPU?

===========================================
CUDA


===========================================

STRONZATE

14) Make it so that all the PT replica flush at the same time when the code is stopped 

25) Fix US weight file so that if order parameter and weight files do not agree then you get undefined behaviour (without warnings). 

26) Find a way of warning the user if velocities are too large in magnitude

27) If external forces are used, the total energy due to the them should be printed in the energy file. !DONE?
