FILES
----- 

- c++ source files should use the file extension .cpp. 
- Every .cpp file should have an associated .h file. The two should be named the 
same, except for the extension.
- Abstract (interface) classes may be defined entirely in a header file (see e.g. 
BaseInteraction.h).
- The .cpp and .h files should have the same name of the class defined therein.  

NAMING CONVENTIONS
------------------

- The name of classes and structures should be in CamelCase (with the first letter
capitalised). Example: ThisIsAClass
- The name of methods, functions and variables should be in lower case. When the 
name is made of distinct words or parts, these should be separated by an underscore.
Example: this_is_a_variable
- Please be as descriptive as you can AT LEAST when naming classes and public methods.
Using long names does not hurt anyone but greatly increases the readability of the 
code.
- The name of private and protected members of classes and structures should be 
prefixed with an underscore. 

CODING STYLE
------------

- Indentation: please use tabs and make sure that your code is well-indented. If 
you are too lazy to do it yourself then install eclipse, open your file and press
ctrl+shift+f :-)
- Braces: for consistency please put opening braces on the same level as function/
method/class declarations and if/for/while statements. The opening brace should 
be preceded by a space. Example:

void my_function() {
	if(1 != 0) {
		printf("what?\n");
		return;
	}
}
