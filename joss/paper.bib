We explain in detail the very complex relationship between the gas-phase base-stacking energies{,} as revealed by quantum chemical (QM) calculations{,} and the highly variable roles of these interactions in nucleic acids. This issue is rarely discussed in quantum chemical and physical chemistry literature. We further extensively discuss methods that are available for base-stacking studies{,} complexity of comparison of stacking calculations with gas phase experiments{,} balance of forces in stacked complexes of nucleic acid bases{,} and the relation between QM and force field descriptions. We also review all recent calculations on base-stacking systems{,} including details analysis of the B-DNA stacking. Specific attention is paid to the highest accuracy QM calculations{,} to the decomposition of the interactions{,} and development of dispersion-balanced DFT methods. Future prospects of computational studies of base stacking are discussed."}

	abstract = {DNA is not only among the most important molecules in life, but a meeting point for biology, physics and chemistry, being studied by numerous techniques. Theoretical methods can help in gaining a detailed understanding of DNA structure and function, but their practical use is hampered by the multiscale nature of this molecule. In this regard, the study of DNA covers a broad range of different topics, from sub-Angstrom details of the electronic distributions of nucleobases, to the mechanical properties of millimeter-long chromatin fibers. Some of the biological processes involving DNA occur in femtoseconds, while others require years. In this review, we describe the most recent theoretical methods that have been considered to study DNA, from the electron to the chromosome, enriching our knowledge on this fascinating molecule.}

	ABSTRACT={The oxDNA model of Deoxyribonucleic acid has been applied widely to systems in biology, biophysics and nanotechnology. It is currently available via two independent open source packages. Here we present a set of clearly documented exemplar simulations that simultaneously provide both an introduction to simulating the model, and a review of the model’s fundamental properties. We outline how simulation results can be interpreted in terms of—and feed into our understanding of—less detailed models that operate at larger length scales, and provide guidance on whether simulating a system with oxDNA is worthwhile.}

The effectiveness of the method for the protein-folding problem is tested with the penta-peptide Met-enkephalin. The method can overcome the multiple-minima problem by exchanging non-interacting replicas of the system at several temperatures. From only one simulation run, one can obtain probability distributions in canonical ensemble for a wide temperature range using multiple-histogram reweighting techniques, which allows the calculation of any thermodynamic quantity as a function of temperature in that range.}

	abstract = {<p>Although the field of structural DNA nanotechnology has been advancing with an astonishing pace, <em>de novo</em> design of complex 3D nanostructures and functional devices remains a laborious and time-consuming process. One reason for that is the need for multiple cycles of experimental characterization to elucidate the effect of design choices on the actual shape and function of the self-assembled objects. Here, we demonstrate a multi-resolution simulation framework, mrdna, that, in 30 min\&nbsp;or less, can produce an atomistic-resolution structure of a self-assembled DNA nanosystem. We demonstrate fidelity of our mrdna framework through direct comparison of the simulation results with the results of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of multiple 3D DNA origami objects. Furthermore, we show that our approach can characterize an ensemble of conformations adopted by dynamic DNA nanostructures, the equilibrium structure and dynamics of DNA objects constructed using off-lattice self-assembly principles, i.e.\&nbsp;wireframe DNA objects, and to study the properties of DNA objects under a variety of environmental conditions, such as applied electric field. Implemented as an open source Python package, our framework can be extended by the community and integrated with DNA design and molecular graphics tools.</p>},

The increasing complexity of novel applications requires significant computational support for the design, modelling and analysis of DNA nanostructures. However, current in silico design tools have not been developed in view of these new applications and their requirements. Here, we present Adenita, a novel software tool for the modelling of DNA nanostructures in a user-friendly environment. A data model supporting different DNA nanostructure concepts (multilayer DNA origami, wireframe DNA origami, DNA tiles etc.) has been developed allowing the creation of new and the import of existing DNA nanostructures. In addition, the nanostructures can be modified and analysed on-the-fly using an intuitive toolset. The possibility to combine and re-use existing nanostructures as building blocks for the creation of new superstructures, the integration of alternative molecules (e.g. proteins, aptamers) during the design process, and the export option for oxDNA simulations are outstanding features of Adenita, which spearheads a new generation of DNA nanostructure modelling software. We showcase Adenita by re-using a large nanorod to create a new nanostructure through user interactions that employ different editors to modify the original nanorod.}",

However, the various structural models currently available for DNA and RNA and their accompanying suites of computational tools can be very rarely used in a synergistic fashion. The tacoxDNA webserver and standalone software package presented here are a step toward a long-sought interoperability of nucleic acids models. The webserver offers a simple interface for converting various common input formats of DNA structures and setting up molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Users can, for instance, design DNA rings with different topologies, such as knots, with and without supercoiling, by simply providing an XYZ coordinate file of the DNA centre-line. More complex DNA geometries, as designable in the cadnano, CanDo and Tiamat tools, can also be converted to all-atom or oxDNA representations, which can then be used to run MD simulations. Though the latter are currently geared toward the native and LAMMPS oxDNA representations, the open-source package is designed to be further expandable.

Over the past several decades, specialized simulation methods have been developed to overcome this problem. We review one recently developed class of such methods, known as forward flux sampling. Forward flux sampling uses a series of interfaces between the initial and final states to calculate rate constants and generate transition paths for rare events in equilibrium or nonequilibrium systems with stochastic dynamics. This review draws together a number of recent advances, summarizes several applications of the method and highlights challenges that remain to be overcome.}
